# General Notes about levels:

> [!CAUTION]
> The user/password are found in a level $n$ for the level $n+1$ so, they are stored in that order. For example: user and password for level four are in the row of the level 3, because they are provided in that level. Then they are for the next level.

| Level(&url) | Titlepage | Notes | User | Password |
|-------------|-----------|-------|------|----------|
| [Level 1](https://wronghole.net/levels/levelone.htm) | Welcome   | Weird red circle in the top of a building | NA | NA |
| [Level 2](https://wronghole.net/levels/light/on.htm) | It's too damn bright! | Just the image I guess | NA | NA |
| [Level 3](https://wronghole.net/levels/light/off.htm) | U/P = //?//, //?// | This title is like the "way" they hide the user/password for the next level. The title suggest like //user// //password// is in that format. The text contains *"Froople (SE21)"* which I don't know what is. | usually | alive | 
| [Level 4](https://wronghole.net/levels/dark/) | 72826 | The picture is a microphone (thats all I guess) | crawl | away |
| [Level 5](https://wronghole.net/levels/lighter/) | What's next? | The picture suggest a pattern (light/dark/lighter/darker) which gives you the next level url. Also there is a series of numbers, that is ASCII coded user/password | next | door |
| [Level 5bis](https://wronghole.net/levels/darker/) | NA | Just the url for the next level | NA | NA |
| [Level 6](https://wronghole.net/levels/darker/night.htm) | Schau genauer hin... | The title means "look closer" in german. In the roof of the image there is a text (my blood before me begs me) that means "Mi sangre ante mí me suplica". The key is that "you only need the lowercase letter". This one is kinda tricky. You have to search "my blood before me begs me" and the letter will appear, but "H" is not the name of the level, the name is "aitch" which is the spelling. | next | door |
| [Level 6bis](https://wronghole.net/levels/darker/h.htm) | NA | In case you use h.htm in the level 6, this level says that you have to spell the letter. | NA | NA |
| [Level 7](https://wronghole.net/levels/darker/aitch.htm) | Ik ben Brits, weet je nog... | The title means I'm British, remember... There are 6 images. 5 about sausages and 1 about keyboard. The keyboard allows you to make the text "tick.htm" which I will consider the level 7bis | history | symbolic |
| [Level 7bis](https://wronghole.net/levels/darker/tick.htm) | NA | This level has hidden secrets that are very large to descrive here, so follow [this file](misc/level_7.md) to get all | NA | NA |
| [Level 8](https://wronghole.net/levels/incredible) | Hey, hexy! | The idea is to substract `ff-21` `ff-52` `ff-12`. That gives you the url to the next level (same passwd)  | NA | NA |
| [Level 9](https://wronghole.net/levels/incredible/deaded.htm) | He killed Ed! You bastard | The idea here is to reveal the metadata of the image. This reveal a map coordenate: [`54°16'57.1"N 0°23'45.7"W`](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7pYrk7AdE8ALnaMo8) which is the usr/psswd for the next level. The url appears if you touch the nose of the man in the image. | coney | island |
| [Level 10](https://wronghole.net/levels/roadtrip/) | ///wanted.cooks.camera | This level has many images. One redirects you to the lvl10bis. This level gives you the url for the next level `/milkers`. More about this lvl [here](misc/level_10.md) | NA | NA |
| [Level 10bis](https://wronghole.net/levels/roadtrip/log.htm) | UFO Flight Log | This level gives you the information that you need to write 2 characters in the map image: `s` and `t` | soft | udder | 
| [Level 11](https://wronghole.net/levels/milkers) | Geen ademhaling! | The title means: No breathing! There are 2 images. One has the url for the next level. The other is just a cake | ? | ? |
| [Level 12](https://wronghole.net/levels/animals) | | | | |
