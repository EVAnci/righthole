                Congrats! 
                
                You've made it this far, easy huh?
                Well not for long.

                From now on the levels are less hand-holdy.
                It'll be up to you to find the hints and clues
                required to solve the levels.

                Before you go, here's an unexhaustive checklist of
                places you can //usually// find them:

                - In the URL
                - In the page's title
                - Page source code (typically in comments, like this!)
                - In the images

                Level answers are typically usernames and password to
                the next level or a URL.

                and a mod will try and help you!

                Remember that you should always ignore anything
                Google related, i.e., check line no. 8 of this
                file. It's how we keep the site //alive//!

                Levels can be damn hard but keep going and most
                of all have fun!

                PS: Next level -> /levels/dark
                
                PSS: The next level is the first one to require a 
                Username / Password which has been hidden somewhere in this level ;)
